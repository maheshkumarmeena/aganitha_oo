1. The above java package contains java classes. It can be downlaoded and Tested in **Eclipse** or any other java Editor.

  Here,

  I have created a java package named **aganitha_oo_design** which includes base class *X* containing init(name),execute(dict) and shutdown() methods.
  The class X will be inherited to subclasses **A , B and C** to use and override their methods with their own implementation.
  The classes A,B,C are initialized with parameterized constructor while creating the objects.
  These objects are then used to invoke their respective class methods.

2. The file python_oops can be run as on command line via file name or the code can pe copied to run it in **jupyter notebook**

  Here,
  I have created XYZ class with name and id attributes and the execution function is also there.
  This whole class is implemented via objects in main method in the same script.
  This main method contains a loop which prompt user to give name of object of XYZ class or quit to exit.
  Finally a counter i-1 to contain number of class objects
