The above java package contains java classes. It can be downlaoded and Tested in **Eclipse** or any other java Editor.

Here,

I have created a java package named **aganitha_oo_design** which includes base class *X* containing init(name),execute(dict) and shutdown() methods.
The class X will be inherited to subclasses **A , B and C** to use and override their methods with their own implementation.
The classes A,B,C are initialized with parameterized constructor while creating the objects.
These objects are then used to invoke their respective class methods.
